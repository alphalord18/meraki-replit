when writing or reading the firestore database, u use [firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@merakifest-d9822.iam.gserviceaccount.com](mailto:firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@merakifest-d9822.iam.gserviceaccount.com) as the client email id. on the sponsors page, give an option of 3-4 packages and an option to contact for sponsorship. all the pages like events, blogs, speakers, sponsors are empty, fill them with some temporary things. A few more changes that I wanted are - 1. On the home page, at the hero section, add a background of people debating. 2. At Events, remove the register now button and make the event block a clickable block that shows all the details including rules, etc. of the event, It should have a proper animation that it increases, comes to the center and background is blured, when clicked on any side, it goes back to the normal registration page. 3. Do same with speakers page, when clicked, increase details for the speakers. 4. Make the blog button also clickable and redirect to a new page for that blog where full blog is seen. 5. In sponsors, add past sponsors also which goes from right to left continously in a loop forever with just the logo. The contact us button on the packages should be in one line on the bottom of that box. 6. Make the login page where coordinator email and the password generated by u can be used to login and details which were filled can be edited.
